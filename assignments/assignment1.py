# Accessing the Twitter API
# This script describes the basic methodology for accessing a Twitter feed
# or something similar.

from requests_oauthlib import OAuth2Session
from oauthlib.oauth2 import BackendApplicationClient
import json

# In order to use this script, you must:
# - Have a Twitter account and create an app
# - Store in keys.json a property called "twitter" whose value is an
#     object with two keys, "key" and "secret"
with open('keys.json', 'r') as f:
   keys = json.loads(f.read())['twitter']

twitter_key = keys['key']

# We authenticate ourselves with the above credentials
# We will demystify this process later
#
# For documentation, see http://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html
# and http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/

                          client_secret=twitter_secret)

# Base url needed for all subsequent queries
base_url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/'

# Particular page requested. The specific query string will be
# appended to that.
page = 'search/tweets.json'

# Depending on the query we are interested in, we append the necessary string
# As you read through the twitter API, you'll find more possibilities
req_url = base_url + page + '?q=%40HanoverCollege'

# We perform a request. Contains standard HTTP information
response = oauth.get(req_url)

# Read the query results
results = json.loads(response.content.decode('utf-8'))

## Process the results
