## Course Description

THE REST OF THIS DOCUMENT IS WORK IN PROGRESS

## Course Components

### Reading Assignments

In the [class schedule page](skiadas.github.io/NumberTheoryCourse/site/schedule.html) you will find, for each class day, a list of links to reading assignments. Your homework will require you to have a solid understanding of the material covered there, so I strongly encourage you not to get behind.

### Class Attendance

You are expected to attend every class meeting. You are only allowed to miss 3 classes without excuse. From that point on, every unexcused absence will result in a reduction of your final score by one percentage point, up to a total of 5 points. Excused absences should be arranged in advance, and backed by appropriate documentation. Emergencies will be dealt with on an individual basis. There are very few reasons that would qualify as an excuse for an absence.

### Lab Assignments

There will be lab assignments roughly once or twice each week. You are expected to work on these assignments on your own, but you are welcome to ask me questions, and you are welcome to discuss general topics related to the assignment with your classmates. We will typically start these assignments in class.

### Exams

There will be one midterm, on Friday, October 14th, and a final/2nd midterm during finals week. **You have to be here for the exams**. If you have conflicts with these days, let me know as soon as possible. Do not plan your vacation before you are aware of the finals schedule. In terms of your final grade, the exams you did better on will weigh more.

### Project

TODO

### Getting Help

- You should never hesitate to ask me questions. I will never think any less of anyone for asking a question. Stop by my office hours or just email me your question, which has the great benefit of forcing you to write it down in clear terms, which often helps you understand it better.
- You are allowed, and in fact encouraged, to work together and help each other regarding the class material, as well as the topics related to the lab assignments. However, you may NOT directly help each other with your lab assignments.

## Grading

Your final grade depends on class attendance, homework, midterms and the final, as follows:

     Component   Percent
--------------  --------
    Attendance        5%
   Assignments       30%
       Project       25%
    Worst Exam       15%
     Best Exam       25%

This gives a number up to 100, which is then converted to a letter grade based roughly on the following correspondence:

 Letter grade     Percentage Range
--------------   -----------------
   A, A-                  90%-100%
   B+, B, B-               80%-90%
   C+, C, C-               70%-80%
   D+, D, D-               60%-70%
      F                     0%-60%
